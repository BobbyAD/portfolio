This is my personal portfolio. If you're familiar with React you can repurpose it by altering the "projects" object, as well as changing other portions of text to fit your own needs.

It's a work in progress, and likely always will be. In the future I may move the text portions over to a database, to allow for more modularity and the ability for me to change the content of the site without rebuilding it.
